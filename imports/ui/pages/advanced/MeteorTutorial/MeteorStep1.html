To create a Meteor application you must first install Meteor on your machine. This is a pretty easy process, simply follow the instructions at the Meteor website:

<a href="https://www.meteor.com/install">Meteor Installation</a>

Once Meteor is installed on your computer you are ready to create your first application. Open a command prompt window and type:

`meteor create patient-todo`

This will tell Meteor to create the basic framework and directory structure for your application. There is simple built-in webpage to test that meteor is working. At the command prompt, navigate to the directory of your application:

`cd patient-todo`
    
and then simply type:

`meteor`

Hit enter and the Meteor framework will begin to build your application. The first time you run Meteor at the command line it will take a bit to download all the necessary components and start your application. Once the process is completed you should see a message at the command prompt that looks like this:

<div class="col-md-6 text-center">
    <img src="./AppTutorial/MeteorFirstStart.JPG" />
</div>

If you then open a web browser (Google Chrome is recommended for its debugging capabilities) and type `localhost:3000` into the address bar you should see a web page like below. The `localhost` portion of the address is telling the web browser to reference the local computer (the one you are using) and the `:3000` is directing it to PORT 3000, which is the default port that Meteor applications use. If you have another program running on PORT 3000 then you may receive an error at the command line and the application will fail to load.

If everything went well, you should now see this in your web browser:

<div class="col-md-6 text-center">
    <img src="./AppTutorial/MeteorNewAppPlaceholder.JPG" />
</div>

You can stop the Meteor application from running at the command line by typing `CTRL-C`. The application will exit and you will be back to the command prompt. Stop the application now so that we can complete the final portion of Step 1.

We will add one directory to the application structure to eventually hold our database collection code. From the command line (or file explorer), make a new folder in the project dierectory called `imports`. Your project directory should look something like this:

```
.meteor
client
	main.css
	main.html
	main.js
import
node_modules
server
	main.js
```

Now that we have installed Meteor and created the basic framework for our application, lets add a few additional building blocks to make our job even easier. Proceed to Step 2.
